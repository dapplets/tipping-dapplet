Now the dapplet is turned on. You will see two new icons in your Twitter profile.

**The first icon** shows the number of NEAR tokens that were donated to you, but which you have not received, as you have not yet connected your Twitter account to NEAR. If you click on this icon you will see the following message: *«You must link NEAR account before continue»*. To link our account let’s go to the second icon.

**The second icon** shows if your Twitter account is connected to NEAR. If you click on the icon you will see the following message: *«Add NEAR Account ID in your profile name before continue»*. This means that to connect your account you need to type *yourname.testnet* next to your name.

## Wallet Connection

To interact with the Tipping NEAR Dapplet, you need to connect a wallet.

1. Click on **Dapplets Extension** Icon. The overlay will open.

Done, your Twitter account is now linked to your Near.testnet account

## Accepting donated tokens

If you already have tokens that were donated to you by other users, you can collect them by clicking:
![image](/assets/18.png)

The button will show how many tokens were donated to you at the moment, which you have not yet collected.

When you click on the button a new page will open.

Click **Allow** to accept the tokens donated to you.

After this, the **Claim** button should change to 0 and the tokens should be added to your account.

## Donating tokens to other users

Look at the new icon that is now displayed next to any tweet, yours, or any other user’s:

![image](/assets/20.png)

This icon has two functions:
1. Displaying the number of NEAR tokens you were given or that you yourself have donated. 
2. Donating NEAR tokens to a tweet. 

Every click on the button increases the total donation by 0.05 NEAR. The transaction has a delay, which allows you to click several times to increase the donation. You can try sending yourself some tokens to see how it works.

Choose one of your own tweets, and donate a few tokens to yourself. When you do this, a page will open:

Click **Allow** and the tokens will be sent. The counter will increase by the number of tokens you have donated. The maximum amount you can donate in one transaction is equal to 1 token. The maximum per one tweet - 10 tokens. 

## Increasing the standard tipping amount

At this moment, one click, or as we call it - step, is equal to 0.05 tokens. For your convenience, we’ve added the ability to change this number, higher or lower. 

To do this, please follow the instructions below:

1. Click on **Dapplets Extension**
2. Find **Tipping NEAR Dapplet**
3. Click on the *Gear Wheel*
