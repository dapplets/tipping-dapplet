# Twitter Tipping Dapplet

**Twitter Tipping Dapplet** is a dapplet (an augmentation module for [Dapplets browser extension](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-extension/releases/latest)) that can connect your Twitter profile with your NEAR crypto wallet and send donations to any other Twitter user. Your own tweets can also receive donations from others right on Twitter page.

This dapplet works as a tool for community managers, helping them to motivate and evolve community members. Useful or important tweets can now be rewarded financially. 

# Disclaimer

Dapplet is designed to work in desktop Chromium browser. Working in the mobile browser is not guaranteed.

**The first icon** shows the number of NEAR tokens that were donated to you, but which you have not received, as you have not yet connected your Twitter account to NEAR. If you click on this icon you will see the following message: *«You must link NEAR account before continue»*. To link our account let’s go to the second icon.

**The second icon** shows if your Twitter account is connected to NEAR. If you click on the icon you will see the following message:

**⚠ Now you can delete the name of your NEAR wallet from Twitter profile username.**

# Accepting donated tokens

If you already have tokens that were donated to you by other users, you can collect them by clicking:

![image](/assets/18.png)

The button will show how many tokens were donated to you at the moment, which you have not yet collected.

When you click on the button a new page will open. 

![image](/assets/19.jpg)

Click **Allow** to accept the tokens donated to you.

After this, the **Claim** button should change to 0 and the tokens should be added to your account.

# Donating tokens to other users

Look at the new icon that is now displayed next to any tweet, yours, or any other user’s:

![image](/assets/20.png)

This icon has two functions:
1. Displaying the number of NEAR tokens you were given or that you yourself have donated. 
2. Donating NEAR tokens to a tweet. 

Every click on the button increases the total donation by 0.05 NEAR. The transaction has a delay, which allows you to click several times to increase the donation. You can try sending yourself some tokens to see how it works.

Choose one of your own tweets, and donate a few tokens to yourself. When you do this, a page will open:
![image](/assets/21.jpg)

Click **Allow** and the tokens will be sent. The counter will increase by the number of tokens you have donated. The maximum amount you can donate in one transaction is equal to 1 token. The maximum per one tweet - 10 tokens. 

# Increasing the default tipping amount

At this moment, one click, or as we call it - step, is equal to 0.05 tokens. For your convenience, we’ve added the ability to change this number, higher or lower. 

To do this, please follow the instructions below:

1. Click on **Dapplets Extension**
2. Find **Tipping NEAR Dapplet**
3. Click on the *Gear Wheel*
